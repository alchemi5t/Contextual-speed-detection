# Contextual-speed-detection

In the work, we aim to estimate the speed of a moving vehicle. The input to the model is a dash camera video feed and the output is the predicted speed. We use Gunnar Farneback optical flow as feature extractor and train a baseline Convolutional Neural Network model and a Contextual Convolution model with the same parameters. Our results show that contextual convolutions improve the performance of the speed detection system.
